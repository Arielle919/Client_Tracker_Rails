Feature: User SplashPage
  As a user
  I want to be able to see the main splash page
  When I come to the ClientTracker Website

 Scenario: User 1st glance at home page without sign up
    When I go to the homepage
    Then I should see "Sign in or Sign up to start organizing your business while making money using ClientTracker"
